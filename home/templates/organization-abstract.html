            <h2>Organization abstract</h2>
            <p>DATA has been founded in 1994 as a research consulting firm to applying its technical expertise in support of finding solutions to pressing social and economic challenges in Bangladesh.

The professionals of DATA are proud of their substantive contribution to IFPRI's successful research outcomes in Bangladesh. Members of DATA were involved in the project in various capacities that include enumeration, supervision, questionnaire preparation and editing, preparation of computerized data entry modules, cleaning, and analysis.</p>
